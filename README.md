# Real-Time Signal Viewer

## Overview
This project is a real-time signal viewer that provides a user-friendly interface for loading, displaying, and manipulating biological or non-biological signals. The viewer offers various features to enhance the user's experience and analysis capabilities.

## Features
- **Real-Time Signal Display**
  - Load and display one or more signals in real-time on the screen.

- **Signal Operations**
  - Select any displayed signal to perform the following operations:
    - Change color
    - Take snapshots
    - Calculate data (as shown in the attached files)
    - Show or hide
    - Move it between two graphs
    - Change speed
    - Change name

- **Zooming**
  - Zoom in and out of the displayed signals for detailed analysis.

- **Start and Stop Display**
